diabetic retinopathy

#WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?
Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes related defect caused by the swelling or leaking or closing or abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. Simply put, it affects the eye. Specialists currently take an enormous amount of time to examine fundus images. When not treated early it could lead to blindness. Recent studies have demonstrated that the number of cases with diabetic retinopathy (DR) has increased by 89% since 2000. In 2025, it is expected that 333 million diabetic patients worldwide will require annual retinal examination for the screening and monitoring of diabetic retinopathy. It is in this regard that there should be fast, cheap and efficient automatic screening systems to detect early stages of diabetic retinopathy for early treatment in order to prevent adverse effects such as blindness which is unfortunately on the rise. There is therefore the need to come up with effective algorithms, and consequently suitable implementation of these algorithms. As an open source project, sharing of improved and better algorithms or implementation in any other programming language for the purposes of providing cheap or free healthcare is allowed.

#WHY THIS PROJECT?
Given the above stated problem, it is prudent to provide a computer based solution that is efficient and available for free, hence the initiative to start an open source machine learning based system for the detection of diabetic retinopathy.

#WHO IS BEHIND THIS?
This project is initiated, managed and supported by the OSP division of SOFTVISION.CO, a tech company found in Ghana. The core philosophy of this group is to use open source software as a tool for philanthropy. After initiation of this project, there is the need for continuity and hence this project belongs to any one with the urge and capability to help improve healthcare through technology.
